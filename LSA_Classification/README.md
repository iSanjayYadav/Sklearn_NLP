This is a simple text classification example using Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA), written in Python and using the scikit-learn library. 

This code goes along with an LSA tutorial blog post I wrote [here](http://mccormickml.com/2016/03/25/lsa-for-text-classification-tutorial/).

Steps:

1. [Optional]: Run `getReutersTextArticles.py` to download the Reuters dataset and extract the raw text. This step has already been performed for you, and the dataset is stored in the 'data' folder.
2. Run `runClassification_LSA.py` to apply LSA to the dataset and then test classification accuracy.
3. Run `inspect_LSA.py` to gain some insight into what LSA is doing.
